Tl;dr- downloading utorrent caused other torrent clients to hang and crash while utorrent itself runs smoothly. Did fresh installs many times but everything hangs up frequently but utorrent and bittorrent run smooth Hey everyone. Been noticing a strange thing happening with torrent clients. qbittorrent, deluge, and azureus have been freezing randomly and taking a huge long time to even get started. In stark contrast utorrent and bittorrent have been working smooth. It happened 
The official ¬µTorrent¬Æ (uTorrent) torrent client for Windows, Mac, Android and Linux-- uTorrent is the #1 BitTorrent download client on desktops worldwide. Every torrent software I download such as, Utorrent and bittorrent come with some adware called webhelper or some shit like that, mabye it was adhelper, the logo was 3 orange triangles upside down. Ive had to factory reset several times, its always the same software and it disables restore to previous version EDIT: I selected keep personal files this time and Im not sure if this will remove. uTorrent 3.5.5 build 45095. ¬µTorrent - –ø–æ–ø—É–ª—è—Ä–Ω—ã–π –∫–ª–∏–µ–Ω—Ç –ø–∏—Ä–∏–Ω–≥–æ–≤—ã—Ö p2p-—Å–µ—Ç–µ–π (–ø—Ä–æ—Ç–æ–∫–æ–ª BitTorrent), –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—ã–π. I'm trying to share some large video files and since my internet connection is bad, I thought I'd use torrents so that the upload doesn't get canceled every 15 minutes. I created a torrent with a list of trackers I found, but when it comes time to seeding it, it just won't do. I don't know, it appears as seeding in my torrent program (tried several, utorrent, deluge, bittorrent.), but there are no incoming connections and to the leecher it appears as though there are no seeders. I'm positive. uTorrent ‚Äî —Å–∞–º—ã–π –ø–æ–ø—É–ª—è—Ä–Ω—ã–π –∏ –∫–æ–º–ø–∞–∫—Ç–Ω—ã–π –∫–ª–∏–µ–Ω—Ç –¥–ª—è —Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç—ã –≤ —Å–µ—Ç–∏ BitTorrent. –í –æ—Ç–ª–∏—á–∏–µ –æ—Ç —Å—Ç–∞–Ω–¥–∞—Ä—Ç–Ω–æ–≥–æ —Å–ø–æ—Å–æ–±–∞ –∑–∞–≥—Ä—É–∑–∫–∏ —Ñ–∞–π–ª–æ–≤ –ø–æ—Å—Ä–µ–¥—Å—Ç–≤–æ–º –≤–µ–±-–±—Ä–∞—É–∑–µ—Ä–∞, –¥–∞–Ω–Ω—ã–µ –ø–æ —Å–µ—Ç–∏ BitTorrent –æ—Ç–ø—Ä–∞–≤–ª—è—é—Ç—Å—è —á–∞—Å—Ç—è–º–∏.

I changed my motherboard and it now supports my internet. I had an old motherboard with 100mb internet support and had a maximum speed of 12.5mbps download everywhere, in torrent programs like utorrent and bittorrent, but in Steam and Origin aswell. Since I have a 500mbps connection and can now use it with my new PC, I have dowload speed ONLY in Steam and Origin of \~66mbps, but it's "blocked" in torrent programs on exactly 10mbps. It's not the torrents, they have a lot of peers,etc. It's really. uTorrent ‚Äî —ç—Ç–æ —Å–∞–º—ã–π –ø–æ–ø—É–ª—è—Ä–Ω—ã–π –∫–ª–∏–µ–Ω—Ç P2P-—Å–µ—Ç–∏ BitTorrent (—Ç–æ—Ä—Ä–µ–Ω—Ç-–∫–ª–∏–µ–Ω—Ç). –ë—ã—Å—Ç—Ä—ã–π, —Ñ—É–Ω–∫—Ü–∏–æ–Ω–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã–π, —É–º–Ω—ã–π –∏ –∫—Ä–∞—Å–∏–≤—ã–π. Looking to get back in to torrenting. I've seen positive things about TorGuard but I don't think they're outside the fourteen eyes. Should I be concerned? Also, anyone recommend a torrenting program?

Hey, As I said in the title, nothing works. All it says is "the system cannot find the path specified (write to disk error)". I tried changing the program (same thing happened on utorrent and bittorrent, freshly installed), manually setting location, saving on the disc without any folders, changing security settings on my folders. Nothing works. Any help would be appreciated, I'm tired of googling the topic and only finding the same solutions over and over again, that don't It's less of a functionality issue and more of an aesthetic request XD. We get a basic progress bar and a Pieces: x (of x), which are nice, but I'd like it if in a future version we could get a "Percentage Saved" box on the information so we can get a more precise grasp on how much is downloaded, and perhaps one of those more complex bars under Files that shows the all the parts along the sequence of the files that have been saved. And maybe an option to have some information appear Not sure if this belongs here but I was wondering is there a client that is user friendly for the androidtv os? I have used a bunch on my pc utorrent qtorrent bittorrent vuse etc. have a nvidia shield and want to try using it to download to an attached external drive. I have tried flud but it does not give me the option to set the download. 
Hey all, So i'm trying to learn how to torrent but I can't seem to get anything to work. I am using a 2017 Macbook pro. I have downloaded both utorrent and bittorrent to try and be able to download something. I am trying to download off of TPB and when I click "get this torrent" it will ask me if I want to open utorrent and then I click yes and then nothing happens. When I click the utorrent icon in my dock the program will not pop up. What am I doing wrong. I‚Äôve had PIA for 2 years now, but recently (in the last 3 months) started having really significant issues with it. Essentially, regardless of how much I dick around with changing ports and protocols and regions, I can barely get anything downloaded. When connected, the internet hardly works as well. Every once in a blue moon I‚Äôll get lucky and get a torrent downloaded, but even now I‚Äôve got several files sitting at ‚Äúconnecting to peers 0.00%.‚Äù I‚Äôve tried both utorrent and BitTorrent https://torrentfreak.com/spotify-owned-utorrent-before-bittorrent-acquired-it-180305/. So I'm someone who's used to the standard uTorrent BitTorrent clients, whereas, you add a torrent file, and it downloads into your default download folder. My only experience with a seedbox was when it charged you by how many gigabytes you wanted to use up, think it was called Speed Torrent or something, but it completely disappeared. So now I've looked at sites like Evoseedbox, and clients like rTorrent, however, not having superior wisdom of networking, FTP and manual building I've been downloading torrents on utorrent for many years, but since a couple of days now, most of the torrents I download just won't go past 0%. Some will either be stuck at 'connecting to peers' or 'downloading meta data' or just the plain old 'downloading', but it won't actually download. And it's not like those torrents are duds. Maybe one I can understand, or even two, but most of the torrents I downloaded were well seeded and leeched. I've only had maybe a 10% success Nothing I try to download on either utorrent or bittorrent is downloading. I am on Mac OS X sierra. As title say I'm on Windows 10 and Utorrent and Bittorrents latest version get stuck in "Not Responding" with their latest update. Program speed is so sluggish, laggy its basically impossible to use unless you have the utmost patience. This is on a brand new build with legit copy of Windows 10. Here's the kicker I downloaded old version (3.4.5) of uTorrent and Bittorrent and they work FLAWLESSLY except for one issue: They both want to auto update and there is nothing Mostly asking about utorrent and bittorrent and their remote. 
I've seen a lot of people asking What's the best client to use and what client to move to from utorrent or BitTorrent it might also help the new people to getting a esay use client that works. Hi! I have a question about torrenting, more specifically what bit torrent is. from my understanding bittorrent is a name for a peer to peer file share that takes place over the internet. Are there other ways to download a torrent? or is bit torrent the only way. Is bit torrent just a name for a a small piece of data? all software such as utorrent, vuze, bittorrent, and the countless others all use bittorrents correct? thanks. It used to worked, but after I format it, it stopped working. I've already tried everything but it won't work. I can install it, but when I run it, it will open and get stuck with the "not responding" sign, whether is utorrent or bittorrent. Others like deluge won't even work. -I've run utorrent in compatibility mode -run it as administrator -uninstall/install (using revo uninstaller) -fixed every problem with windows update -allow it through firewall -checked malware -installed older versions. So I recently purchased TotalVPN's 2 year package. Although it does seem to change my ip, there is the small problem that whenever I try to use utorrent, or bittorrent, the files don't download. I've talked to them every day for the past week, and every day they tell me the issue will be fixed within 24 hours, and yet no progress. I have them for 2 years now though, so hopefully they can fix it within I've tried utorrent and bittorrent and those gave me abysmal speeds over WiFi. Any other client you'd suggest. </p>
